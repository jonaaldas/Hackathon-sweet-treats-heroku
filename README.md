# Sweet Treats App
Sweet Treats is an app that I built with two other people in the hackathon I participated. Its main purpose is to help small business owners migrate their business online.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I built the check-out feature using vanilla JS 

## Lessons Learned:

 1. Building software in a short period of time is hard
 2. Working with other people and learning how they work and manage team expectations is hard
 3. Shipping software in a short period of time is very difficult
 4. Learned how to use Git and GitHub 

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
